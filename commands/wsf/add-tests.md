<objective>
Generate unit and E2E tests for a completed phase, using its SUMMARY.md, CONTEXT.md, and VERIFICATION.md as specifications.

Analyzes implementation files, classifies them into TDD (unit), E2E (browser), or Skip categories, presents a test plan for user approval, then generates tests following RED-GREEN conventions.

Output: Test files committed with message `test(phase-{N}): add unit and E2E tests from add-tests command`

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (first positional argument is phase number)
Project: optional second positional argument (e.g., `space-flow`). If specified, resolve to `$PROJECT_ROOT=projects/<project>/` via `wsf-tools init`.

<process>
Execute the add-tests workflow from @~/.claude/wsf/workflows/add-tests.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (classification approval, test plan approval, RED-GREEN verification, gap reporting).
