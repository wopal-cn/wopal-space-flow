<objective>
Bridge local completion → merged PR. After /wsf-verify-work passes, ship the work: push branch, create PR with auto-generated body, optionally trigger review, and track the merge.

Closes the plan → execute → verify → ship loop.
</objective>

</context>

Execute the ship workflow from @~/.claude/wsf/workflows/ship.md end-to-end.
