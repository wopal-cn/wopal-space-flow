## Code Quality Commands

### `/wsf-code-review`

Review source files changed during a phase for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality problems.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `N` | **Yes** | Phase number whose changes to review (e.g., `2` or `02`) |
| `--depth=quick\|standard\|deep` | No | Review depth level (overrides `workflow.code_review_depth` config). `quick`: pattern-matching only (~2 min). `standard`: per-file analysis with language-specific checks (~5–15 min, default). `deep`: cross-file analysis including import graphs and call chains (~15–30 min) |
| `--files file1,file2,...` | No | Explicit comma-separated file list; skips SUMMARY/git scoping entirely |

**Prerequisites:** Phase has been executed and has SUMMARY.md or git history
**Produces:** `{phase}-REVIEW.md` in phase directory with severity-classified findings
**Spawns:** `wsf-code-reviewer` agent

```bash
/wsf-code-review 3                          # Standard review for phase 3
/wsf-code-review 2 --depth=deep             # Deep cross-file review
/wsf-code-review 4 --files src/auth.ts,src/token.ts  # Explicit file list
```

---

### `/wsf-code-review-fix`

Auto-fix issues found by `/wsf-code-review`. Reads `REVIEW.md`, spawns a fixer agent, commits each fix atomically, and produces a `REVIEW-FIX.md` summary.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `N` | **Yes** | Phase number whose REVIEW.md to fix |
| `--all` | No | Include Info findings in fix scope (default: Critical + Warning only) |
| `--auto` | No | Enable fix + re-review iteration loop, capped at 3 iterations |

**Prerequisites:** Phase has a `{phase}-REVIEW.md` file (run `/wsf-code-review` first)
**Produces:** `{phase}-REVIEW-FIX.md` with applied fixes summary
**Spawns:** `wsf-code-fixer` agent

```bash
/wsf-code-review-fix 3                      # Fix Critical + Warning findings for phase 3
/wsf-code-review-fix 3 --all               # Include Info findings
/wsf-code-review-fix 3 --auto              # Fix and re-review until clean (max 3 iterations)
```

---

### `/wsf-audit-fix`

Autonomous audit-to-fix pipeline — runs an audit, classifies findings, fixes auto-fixable issues with test verification, and commits each fix atomically.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--source <audit>` | Which audit to run (default: `audit-uat`) |
| `--severity high\|medium\|all` | Minimum severity to process (default: `medium`) |
| `--max N` | Maximum findings to fix (default: 5) |
| `--dry-run` | Classify findings without fixing (shows classification table) |

**Prerequisites:** At least one phase has been executed with UAT or verification
**Produces:** Fix commits with test verification; classification report

```bash
/wsf-audit-fix                              # Run audit-uat, fix medium+ issues (max 5)
/wsf-audit-fix --severity high             # Only fix high-severity issues
/wsf-audit-fix --dry-run                   # Preview classification without fixing
/wsf-audit-fix --max 10 --severity all     # Fix up to 10 issues of any severity
```

## Fast & Inline Commands

### `/wsf-fast`

Execute a trivial task inline — no subagents, no planning overhead. For typo fixes, config changes, small refactors, forgotten commits.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `task description` | No | What to do (prompted if omitted) |

**Not a replacement for `/wsf-quick`** — use `/wsf-quick` for anything needing research, multi-step planning, or verification.

```bash
/wsf-fast "fix typo in README"
/wsf-fast "add .env to gitignore"
```

---

### `/wsf-review`

Cross-AI peer review of phase plans from external AI CLIs.

```bash
/wsf-review --phase 3 --all
/wsf-review --phase 2 --gemini
```

---

### `/wsf-pr-branch`

Create a clean PR branch by filtering out `.planning/` commits.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `target branch` | No | Base branch (default: `main`) |

**Purpose:** Reviewers see only code changes, not WSF planning artifacts.

```bash
/wsf-pr-branch                     # Filter against main
/wsf-pr-branch develop             # Filter against develop
```

---

### `/wsf-audit-uat`

Cross-phase audit of all outstanding UAT and verification items.

**Prerequisites:** At least one phase has been executed with UAT or verification
**Produces:** Categorized audit report with human test plan

```bash
/wsf-audit-uat
```

---

### `/wsf-secure-phase`

Retroactively verify threat mitigations for a completed phase.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `phase number` | No | Phase to audit (default: last completed phase) |

**Prerequisites:** Phase must have been executed. Works with or without existing SECURITY.md.
**Produces:** `{phase}-SECURITY.md` with threat verification results
**Spawns:** `wsf-security-auditor` agent

Three operating modes:
1. SECURITY.md exists — audit and verify existing mitigations
2. No SECURITY.md but PLAN.md has threat model — generate from artifacts
3. Phase not executed — exits with guidance

```bash
/wsf-secure-phase                   # Audit last completed phase
/wsf-secure-phase 5                 # Audit specific phase
```

---

### `/wsf-docs-update`

Generate or update project documentation verified against the codebase.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--force` | No | Skip preservation prompts, regenerate all docs |
| `--verify-only` | No | Check existing docs for accuracy, no generation |

**Produces:** Up to 9 documentation files (README, architecture, API, getting started, development, testing, configuration, deployment, contributing)
**Spawns:** `wsf-doc-writer` agents (one per doc type), then `wsf-doc-verifier` agents for factual verification

Each doc writer explores the codebase directly — no hallucinated paths or stale signatures. Doc verifier checks claims against the live filesystem.

```bash
/wsf-docs-update                    # Generate/update docs interactively
/wsf-docs-update --force            # Regenerate all docs
/wsf-docs-update --verify-only      # Verify existing docs only
```

---

## Backlog & Thread Commands

### `/wsf-add-backlog`

Add an idea to the backlog parking lot using 999.x numbering.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | **Yes** | Backlog item description |

**999.x numbering** keeps backlog items outside the active phase sequence. Phase directories are created immediately so `/wsf-discuss-phase` and `/wsf-plan-phase` work on them.

```bash
/wsf-add-backlog "GraphQL API layer"
/wsf-add-backlog "Mobile responsive redesign"
```

---

### `/wsf-review-backlog`

Review and promote backlog items to active milestone.

**Actions per item:** Promote (move to active sequence), Keep (leave in backlog), Remove (delete).

```bash
/wsf-review-backlog
```

---

### `/wsf-plant-seed`

Capture a forward-looking idea with trigger conditions — surfaces automatically at the right milestone.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `idea summary` | No | Seed description (prompted if omitted) |

Seeds solve context rot: instead of a one-liner in Deferred that nobody reads, a seed preserves the full WHY, WHEN to surface, and breadcrumbs to details.

**Produces:** `.planning/seeds/SEED-NNN-slug.md`
**Consumed by:** `/wsf-new-milestone` (scans seeds and presents matches)

```bash
/wsf-plant-seed "Add real-time collaboration when WebSocket infra is in place"
```

---

### `/wsf-thread`

Manage persistent context threads for cross-session work.

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| (none) | — | List all threads |
| `name` | — | Resume existing thread by name |
| `description` | — | Create new thread |

Threads are lightweight cross-session knowledge stores for work that spans multiple sessions but doesn't belong to any specific phase. Lighter weight than `/wsf-pause-work`.

```bash
/wsf-thread                         # List all threads
/wsf-thread fix-deploy-key-auth     # Resume thread
/wsf-thread "Investigate TCP timeout in pasta service"  # Create new
```

---

## State Management Commands

### `state validate`

**Prerequisites:** `.planning/STATE.md` exists
**Produces:** Validation report showing any drift between STATE.md fields and filesystem reality

```bash
node wsf-tools.cjs state validate
```

---

### `state sync [--verify]`

Reconstruct STATE.md from actual project state on disk.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--verify` | Dry-run mode — show proposed changes without writing |

**Prerequisites:** `.planning/` directory exists
**Produces:** Updated `STATE.md` reflecting filesystem reality

```bash
node wsf-tools.cjs state sync             # Reconstruct STATE.md from disk
node wsf-tools.cjs state sync --verify    # Dry-run: show changes without writing
```

---

### `state planned-phase`

Record state transition after plan-phase completes (Planned/Ready to execute).

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--phase N` | Phase number that was planned |
| `--plans N` | Number of plans generated |

**Prerequisites:** Phase has been planned
**Produces:** Updated `STATE.md` with post-planning state

```bash
node wsf-tools.cjs state planned-phase --phase 3 --plans 2
```

---

## Community Commands

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `wsf-validate-commit.sh` | Enforce Conventional Commits format on git commit messages |
